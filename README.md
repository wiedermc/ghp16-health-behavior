# Preventive Behavior and Health Predictors in South Tyrol

**Multivariable Analysis of Preventive Health Behavior Using GHP-16 in a Multilingual Population Sample**

This repository documents the analysis code and macrodata from a population-based study on preventive health behavior conducted in South Tyrol, a culturally and linguistically diverse province in northern Italy. The study examined associations between GHP-16 health behavior scores and predictors such as health literacy, patient activation, mistrust in professional health information, and sociodemographic factors.

## Objectives

- Quantify preventive health behavior using the GHP-16 scale
- Assess associations with health literacy (HLS-EU-Q16), patient activation (PAM-10), and mistrust
- Investigate behavioral differences between language groups
- Support public health planning in multilingual health systems
